When creating web projects start serverless. For those who don’t know what serverless is allow me to explain.
Serverless is an architecture that where you don’t manage servers. Don’t take the name the serverless literal though 
because there is servers but they are managed by vendors such [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com), Azure or Google Cloud(Firebase). 
Why go this route? In the past year when I started working at Entravation building MVP’s for our clients as the one 
of two engineers would take about a month or three to get a project off the ground. There is a lot of overhead to do the entire stack. 
Starting a VPS then disabling the root user securing it, Ip tables yada yada. Then you would start a Postgres database, clone the code into the server,
opening the server. It was a lot. We decided to go to use Heroku instead, but it became expensive in peaks. We went back to PaSS. Later research we found 
out about Nanobox and Docku. Great solutions but still time consuming. We still have to manage the server and run and crashes don't forget crashes on peak. 
Come in serverless and the serverless framework. While many services easy to manage with a service called cloud formations.
